# ArduinoSteeringWheel (need update)
Using just an encoder, a potentiometer for each pedal and an Arduino (only Leonardo tested) it is possible to create a huge steering wheel. Instructions within the code.

* Requires libraries:

ArduinoJoystickLibrary by MHeironimus (https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary).

Encoder by PaulStoffregen (https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/Encoder).
